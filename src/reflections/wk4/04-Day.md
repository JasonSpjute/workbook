## What does REST stand for?

REpresentational State Transfer. When the api is called, the server will Transfer a Representation of the State to the client.

## What does Stateless mean?

This means that the server doesn't remember anything about the person using the API. This means that every request will contain all the information needed by the API, even if you've accessed the API before. 

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

You will use an HTTP method such as get, post, put, and delete. Then you have the base url, such as the www.twitter.com. From there you have the identifier for the resources you want. This is called the endpoint.
