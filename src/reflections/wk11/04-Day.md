# Day-4

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have overall enjoyed my experience at codeworks. There have been a lot of stressful times, but through the hard times, I learned a lot. It is always very rewarding to tackle a tough project and end up with a working application. I've had so many times where I didn't think I could learn this, but eventually I'd have a breakthrough and it all came together. For this final project, I'm planning to have the backend completed over the weekend. Then I would like to get it to a gradeable point by wednesday. That will leave me a couple days to either fix requirements that I didn't quite meet, or add to the styling and fine to it to be a nice portfolio piece.
