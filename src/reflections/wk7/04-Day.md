# Day-4

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Even though we had 3 people, we still implemented pair programming so everyone was working together. We had two navigators and one driver. We used some documentation to help us in the future and also to make note of areas we struggled with or had questions. At the end, we added some styling to make our project more readable and user friendly.

## What went well?

I think the pair programming went really well. We were able to have someone looking through resources and we were able to catch a lot of mistakes up front instead of finding them through errors. I also think we were able to work through some problems together.

## What would you do differently?

Our biggest struggles were in the setup and figuring out how we wanted code in the beginning. Having one person working remotely caused some extra headache in the beginning. I would definitely do all of the setup in the classroom and then have the remote student pull the code down when it's his turn to code. The other issue we had was occasionally we would argue about how to do something instead just writing it out and trying it. This wasted some time. We learned part way through that it's better to actually try it and see if it works than to argue that it won't. Overall though, i think we worked pretty well as a team.
