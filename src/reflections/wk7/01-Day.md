## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is where two programmers share one screen and one keyboard. The person at the keyboard is the driver. They are in charge of typing out the code and ensuring the syntax is correct. The person not at the keyboard is the navigator. They are in charge of thinking ahead keeping track of the big picture.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

There are several benefits to pair programming. It works as a way for a less experience programmer to learn from someone with more experience. It also makes for less interruptions while programming because one person can use the restroom or tend to outside things while the other person continues working. Having two pairs of eyes on the code makes for less mistakes as well.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Pair programming requires both people to be actively engaged. There will also be half the number of people writing code at a time which might slow down productivity. This tends to be offset by the quality of code being written.
