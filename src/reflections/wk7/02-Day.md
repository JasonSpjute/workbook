## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is a way to let your future self and others know what your code is doing and how to use it. This can be done in a readme, a how to guide, or by adding documentation within the code itself.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Code documentation will make it a lot easier for the next guy who uses your code to understand what it does. It can also help you remember. The documentation can also clear up what parameters your function is expecting so the next person doesn't have to figure it out on their own.

## How important is Code documentation and why?

Coding documentation is extremely important for yourself and for other people. It will help you keep track of what your functions do when you look back at your code. If someone else needs to do work on your code, they documentation will save them a lot of time and a headache trying to figure out what is going on.
