## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

The user experience is every interaction that any person has with the application you build. You need to take into account the users thoughts and feelings. You want to be sure not to confuse the customer or rush the customer. You also want your app to show that you care about them and make them feel comfortable.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Taking into account the user experience throughout the development process will help you to build a more user friendly application. It will help your app flow better and will help make the user feel better when using your app.

## Why is the User Experience important?

The user experience is important because they are the whole reason you are building the app. The better you can cater to the user experience the more likely they are to stay on your app longer or use it more often. It can mean the difference between making a sale or not.
