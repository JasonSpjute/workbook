## In your own words, why do we use GIT?
    We use GIT to store the different changes we have made to our code as different versions. This allows us to go back to a previous version if needed. Git also allows us to work with multiple people on the same code at the same time.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
    Multiple branches allow you to try taking your code in separate directions at the same time. In this way, you can test out ideas and bring it all back to the main branch when you know how you want it. 

## WHat is the difference between GIT and GITHUB?
    GIT is local and GITHUB is a remote repository. Using GIT will only give my access to code on my own computer. By using GITHUB, I can access my code anywhere, as well as share my code with whomever I choose.
