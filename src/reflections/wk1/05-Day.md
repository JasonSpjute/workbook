## Open Reflections

This week has definitely been interesting. I haven't done school work in almost a decade. I think I'm doing ok though. During each day I have points where I feel very lost and behind, but also points where I feel very accomplished and like I get it. For the most part, I'm understanding the concepts and I'm able do the challenges. Remembering the different commands and syntax is tough though. I rely a lot on the code from the lecture and google. Overall I think I'm doing well though. I've impressed myself with what i've been able to do and I'm looking forward to learning more.
