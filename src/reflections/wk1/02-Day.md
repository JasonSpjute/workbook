## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

 A pseudo-class defines a special state of an element. I think the ones i will use the most are hover, focus, target, active, and checked

## What is Specificity and how mighty you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is they way we determine which rule will apply to an element when it is being targeted by multiple rules. It creates a hierarchy of most important rules to least important rules. This ensures that even though the code is read top to bottom, the correct rule will be applied in the end. 

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you were to overuse the !important feature, it would be difficult to change the overall theme of your page. Any time you tried to change a css rule, it would be overridden by !important. You would then have to go in and change them all one by one.
