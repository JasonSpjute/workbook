## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    Wire framing is done to basically provide a non-working preview of the website. It allows you to see the layout of each page along with the user flow and functionality. This will ensure everyone is on the same page and it gives the developer a basic start on the skeleton of the website.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
    Low-fidelity wireframes are good for getting the basic layout and navigation of the website. Without focusing on details, you can really look at the big picture.

    Mid- fidelity wireframes are good for getting some more specific components in order. This will give you a better idea of the type of content and and how it will really look.

    Hight-fidelity wireframes good for getting the small details figured out. These show exactly how the website will look and function and are useful in the final stages of development.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort they require? Why or Why not?
    I think it depends on the project. Small projects with only a couple people might not need to spend the time on a wireframe, but I think they are absolutely important for any larger projects that require several people. The wireframe ensures everyone is on the same page and makes it easier to ensure the flow of the website is correct.
