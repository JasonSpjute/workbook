## What is Software Development Testing?

Software development testing is running your code through different scenarios to ensure that it does what it's supposed to do. This is best done in small bits. Test each component separately before adding it to the whole thing.

## What are the benefits of testing in software development?

Testing helps to cut down on the worry that everything is going to work. It gives you confidence that the code you are writing is going to work. It also helps to ensure that you also covered all of the edge cases.

## What are some potential drawbacks of testing in software development?

Testing can take a lot of extra time and money. This is usually offset by the time and money saved in the future trying to fix problems that were not found. However, if testing is done badly, it can eat up a lot of extra time and money for no reason.
