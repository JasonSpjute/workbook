## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing - testing individual units of code in isolation. This allows you to see that every small bit of code is working properly.
Compontent testing - testing individual components by mounting them to the dom. This will show you if your components are workng.
End to end testing - This test covers the entire app. It shows you what users experience when they use your application. 

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think unit testing is the most useful. This is because it breaks your code down and shows you specifically where the problem might lie. You can test small portions and ensure they work.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

End to end testing might be the least useful. While it does show you what the user experiences, it doesn't give you a clear idea of where or why a problem might be.
