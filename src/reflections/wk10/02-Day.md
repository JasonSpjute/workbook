## What is a List in C#?

A list is an object which holds variables in a specific order. This is very similar to lists in Javascript.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Find seems like i would use use it often because there are many times where I would need to grab one itme from a list based on values i give it. List.Add is important for adding items to the list. List.Find would be important for grabbing multiple items that fit my needs. List.remove for removing an item from a list.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You would use a a find method. This is how you would write it: item = list.Find(x => x > value)
