## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories of data types are Value type, reference type, and pointer type. What makes them different is their value is stored in the memory. Value type holds the data value within it's own memory space. Reference type doesn't store the value, it just stores the address where the value exists. Pointer type is a variable that holds the memory address of value types and arrays.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The Value-type holds data within it's own memory space. These include bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. In javascript, you do not need to specify a type of int. In c#, there are several different types of integers.

## In your own words, how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types do not store actual values. They simply store the location where a value is stored. When this variable is called, it will use that location to find the actual value from where it is stored. This is different from Value types because it does not directly store the values in the in the memory.
