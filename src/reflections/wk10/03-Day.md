## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They are symbolic names that represent values. These are used when you have multiple options that a value can be. A good example is high, medium, and low for volume. This would be saved as 1, 2, and 3, but when working with the program, you see high, medum and low.

## How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify an enum by declaring a different data type after declaring the enum itself. You can also change the index of each value within the enum.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I've actually used an enum for a pending status in a relationship model. It was for a friend request essentially. The options were pending, accepted, or declined.
