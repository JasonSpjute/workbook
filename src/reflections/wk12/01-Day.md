## Final Project Reflection

I am feeling really good about the final project for now. My goal was to get the back-end done and passing all the tests over the weekend. I managed to get that done by saturday night. It went a lot smoother than I was planning. I started a bit of work on the front end on sunday, but honestly didn't spend as much time as I could have. I decided to take it easy and hit it hard today. My goal is to have a gradeable(but not perfect) application by wednesday. Depending on how that goes, I'll either work on fixing problems or smoothing out wrinkles and styling for the rest of the week.
