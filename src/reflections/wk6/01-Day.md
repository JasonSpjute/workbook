## What is Component based architecture?

Component based architecture uses many components that are individual features within one main page. Each component has it's own structure, methods, and apis. Each component operates separately from the others, but they all show up on the same page together. They can also be reused in other pages.

## What are some benefits of Component based architcture?

Component based architecture allows each component to refresh separately without refreshing the whole page. It also allows you to reuse the code multiple times, and still be used independently.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Having multiple components rendered on a single page can become overwhelming. If not done right, it can make it more difficult to read and interact with. It also is easy to over engineer with it rather than just using components where needed.
