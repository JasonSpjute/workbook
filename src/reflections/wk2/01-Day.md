## What is scope?

Scope is where a variable is available for use. Global scope means the variable can be accessed anywhere within the whole window. If you set the variable within the function, that makes it function scoped and can only be used within that function.

## What is hoisting?

Hoisting means that javascript moves all variable declarations to the top. This allows you to use a variable before you define it.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
