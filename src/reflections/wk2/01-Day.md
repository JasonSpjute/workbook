## What is scope?

Scope is where a variable is available for use. Global scope means the variable can be accessed anywhere within the whole window. If you set the variable within the function, that makes it function scoped and can only be used within that function.

## What is hoisting?

Hoisting means that javascript moves all variable declarations to the top. This allows you to use a variable before you define it.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Const will be used anytime you don't want the value to change ever. Var will be used if you want it to only apply to the immediate function body. Let will be used if you want it to apply to it's anything within it's block of brackets.
