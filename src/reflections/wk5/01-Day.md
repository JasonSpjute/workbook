## What is the purpose of a query string?

A query string allows passes information to or from a website by adding it to the end of a url. This will tell the website if you want a filter, or a search or something more specific than the general url.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you destinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter starts with a question mark.This is followed by key=value. Multiple queries will be separated by an ampersand.

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters are helpful for using a filter or a search. They are good for finding all the children of a parent using the parent's id.
