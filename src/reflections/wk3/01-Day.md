## What proplem does using exports solve?

Using exports makes it so you don't have to load multiple html script tags. It also makes sure that the only code accessible by other modules is the code you give it access to. 

## How does export differ from export default?

You can export multiple items from a module. If you export default, that will be your export from that module. 

## What is a benefit of using the module system?

Increased performance because there is only one script on the html. Code is split into smaller files of self-contained functionality making it easier to work with.
