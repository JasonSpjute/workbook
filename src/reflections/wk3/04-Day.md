## What problems does the Obeserver Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern helps to keep a bunch of elements synced with the same data. It enables one to many data binding between elements that allows you to build reusable code.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The subscribe method adds observable events.
The unsubscribe method removes observable events.
The broadcast method executes all events with the data.

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
